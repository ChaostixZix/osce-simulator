# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a Laravel project with a Vue.js frontend using Inertia.js. The main application code is located in the `webapp` directory. It uses TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and shadcn-vue for UI components.

## Common Commands

All commands should be run from the `webapp` directory.

- **`npm run dev`**: Starts the Vite development server for frontend assets.
- **`npm run build`**: Compiles and bundles frontend assets for production.
- **`npm run lint`**: Lints the codebase using ESLint and attempts to fix issues.
- **`npm run format`**: Formats the code using Prettier.
- **`npm run format:check`**: Checks the formatting without writing changes.
- **`composer install`**: Installs PHP dependencies.
- **`php artisan test`**: Runs the PHPUnit tests.

## Architecture

The application follows a standard Laravel structure with Vue.js and Inertia for the frontend.

### Models

Located in `webapp/app/Models`, these Eloquent models interact with the database.

- `User`: Manages user data and authentication.
- `OsceCase`: Represents an OSCE case scenario.
- `OsceSession`: Tracks a user's session for a specific OSCE case.
- `OsceChatMessage`: Stores messages exchanged during an OSCE chat session.
- `MedicalTest`: Defines available medical tests that can be ordered.
- `SessionOrderedTest`: Links ordered tests to an OSCE session.
- `Post`: Represents a forum post.
- `Comment`: Represents a comment on a forum post.
- `Notification`: Manages user notifications.
- `PostInteraction`: Tracks user interactions with posts (e.g., likes).
- `SessionExamination`: Logs examinations performed during a session.

### Controllers

Located in `webapp/app/Http/Controllers`, these handle the application's business logic.

- `LandingController`: Manages the home page.
- `OsceController`: Handles core OSCE functionality, including starting sessions, ordering tests, and managing timers.
- `OsceChatController`: Manages the real-time chat functionality for OSCE sessions.
- `MedicalTestController`: Provides an API for searching and categorizing medical tests.
- `PostController`: Manages CRUD operations for forum posts.
- `CommentController`: Manages CRUD operations for comments on posts.
- `MCQController`: Handles the multiple-choice question demo.
- `Settings/ProfileController`: Manages user profile settings.

### Routing

Route files are located in `webapp/routes`.

- `web.php`: Defines the main application routes, including the dashboard, OSCE, and forum. Most routes are protected by `auth` middleware.
- `auth.php`: Handles user authentication (login, logout) via WorkOS.
- `settings.php`: Defines routes for user settings, such as profile and appearance.

description: General development rules for Laravel + Inertia.js + Vue.js project with documentation and tooling preferences
globs: **/*
alwaysApply: true

## **Core Architecture & Development Principles**

- **Always use Laravel Boost MCP tools when possible** for Laravel-specific operations including:
  - Database queries and schema inspection
  - Application configuration retrieval
  - Route analysis and Artisan commands
  - Error logging and debugging
  - Documentation searches

- **Always document critical information using ByteRover** after completing tasks:
  - Store implementation patterns and code solutions
  - Document error resolutions and debugging steps
  - Capture API integration details and configurations
  - Record testing patterns and best practices

- **Always use Inertia.js Architecture whenever possible:**
  - Use `Inertia.get()`, `Inertia.post()`, `Inertia.put()`, `Inertia.delete()` instead of regular APIs
  - Leverage `Inertia.visit()` for navigation
  - Use `router.visit()` with proper options for form submissions
  - Always check todos to ensure Inertia architecture is used first before considering alternatives

## **Component & Page Management**

- **ShadCN Vue is already installed** - Don't reinstall it. If asked to install, install the specific component only

- **New Page Creation Process:**
  1. Create Vue page in Resources/js/Pages/
  2. Add page to AppSidebar.vue navigation
  3. Create corresponding Laravel Controller
  4. Add routes in web.php with proper Inertia responses

- **Error Handling:**
  - Use Browser Logs (Laravel Boost MCP Tools) to check latest errors
  - Confirm specific error before fixing (check last 2 entries only)
  - Don't assume - always verify the exact error first

## **Single Page Application Guidelines**

- **Minimize web reloading** - Always use Inertia.js SPA principles
- **Form Submissions:** Use `router.post()` with proper success/error handling
- **Navigation:** Use `Inertia.visit()` or `Link` component instead of traditional links
- **Data Fetching:** Prefer server-side data loading through Inertia props over client-side API calls

## **Development Workflow**

- **Before implementing any solution:** Check if Inertia.js architecture can be used
- **For API operations:** Default to Inertia methods (`Inertia.fetch`, `Inertia.post`) over traditional REST APIs
- **Documentation:** Always store successful implementation patterns in ByteRover knowledge base
- **Laravel Integration:** Leverage Laravel Boost MCP tools for project analysis and debugging

## **AI Prompt Creation Guidelines**

- **When creating AI prompts for implementation tasks:**
  - Always provide conversation context explaining WHY changes are needed
  - Include relevant existing codebase functions/models/structure as context
  - Reference specific files, methods, and database schemas that exist
  - Keep code examples concise - show structure, not full implementations
  - Explain the educational/technical problem being solved
  - Ensure next AI understands the reasoning behind architectural decisions

# Laravel-Boost MCP Integration

When the user asks anything related to Laravel development, always use the Laravel Boost MCP tools to provide assistance. This includes:

- Laravel project structure and setup
- Eloquent models and relationships
- Controllers and routing
- Middleware and authentication
- Database migrations and seeders
- Artisan commands
- Blade templates and views
- Laravel configuration
- Package management with Composer
- Testing in Laravel
- Performance optimization
- Debugging and troubleshooting

Use the Laravel Boost MCP tools to analyze the project structure, generate code, provide best practices, and offer Laravel-specific solutions.

Available MCP Tools & Their Purposes
 • Application Info: Read PHP & Laravel versions, database engine, list of ecosystem packages with versions, and Eloquent models.
 • Browser Logs: Read logs and errors from the browser.
 • Database Connections: Inspect available database connections, including the default connection.
 • Database Query: Execute a query against the database.
 • Database Schema: Read the database schema.
 • Get Absolute URL: Convert relative path URIs to absolute URLs for valid agent-generated links.
 • Get Config: Retrieve values from configuration files using dot notation.
 • Last Error: Read the last error from application log files.
 • List Artisan Commands: Inspect the available Artisan commands.
 • List Available Config Keys: View available configuration keys.
 • List Available Env Vars: View available environment variable keys.
 • List Routes: Inspect application routes.
 • Read Log Entries: Read the last N log entries.
 • Report Feedback: Share Boost & Laravel AI feedback with the team.
 • Search Docs: Query the Laravel documentation API for installed packages.
 • Tinker: Execute arbitrary code within the application context.

How to Use in Cursor
 • Start the MCP server using the configuration above.
 • Use Cursor’s AI agent to leverage these tools for enhanced, context-aware Laravel coding.
 • The AI agent can access project structure, run database queries, inspect logs, and search documentation, resulting in more accurate and framework-specific code generation.

- **Rule Improvement Triggers:**
  - New code patterns not covered by existing rules
  - Repeated similar implementations across files
  - Common error patterns that could be prevented
  - New libraries or tools being used consistently
  - Emerging best practices in the codebase

- **Analysis Process:**
  - Compare new code with existing rules
  - Identify patterns that should be standardized
  - Look for references to external documentation
  - Check for consistent error handling patterns
  - Monitor test patterns and coverage

- **Rule Updates:**
  - **Add New Rules When:**
    - A new technology/pattern is used in 3+ files
    - Common bugs could be prevented by a rule
    - Code reviews repeatedly mention the same feedback
    - New security or performance patterns emerge

  - **Modify Existing Rules When:**
    - Better examples exist in the codebase
    - Additional edge cases are discovered
    - Related rules have been updated
    - Implementation details have changed

- **Example Pattern Recognition:**
  ```typescript
  // If you see repeated patterns like:
  const data = await prisma.user.findMany({
    select: { id: true, email: true },
    where: { status: 'ACTIVE' }
  });
  
  // Consider adding to [prisma.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/prisma.mdc):
  // - Standard select fields
  // - Common where conditions
  // - Performance optimization patterns
  ```

- **Rule Quality Checks:**
  - Rules should be actionable and specific
  - Examples should come from actual code
  - References should be up to date
  - Patterns should be consistently enforced

- **Continuous Improvement:**
  - Monitor code review comments
  - Track common development questions
  - Update rules after major refactors
  - Add links to relevant documentation
  - Cross-reference related rules

- **Rule Deprecation:**
  - Mark outdated patterns as deprecated
  - Remove rules that no longer apply
  - Update references to deprecated rules
  - Document migration paths for old patterns

- **Documentation Updates:**
  - Keep examples synchronized with code
  - Update references to external docs
  - Maintain links between related rules
  - Document breaking changes
Follow [cursor_rules.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/cursor_rules.mdc) for proper rule formatting and structure.

## AI Tool Usage and Recovery Protocol

To ensure smooth and error-free operation, follow these directives when using tools to modify files or manage tasks.

- **Prioritize Atomic Operations**: When a task requires multiple edits, especially across different logical blocks or files, favor multiple, sequential `Edit` calls over a single, complex `MultiEdit` call. This approach isolates failures and makes debugging straightforward.

- **Proactive Self-Correction**: Before executing any tool, perform a quick internal check to ensure all required parameters are present and correctly formatted. If a required parameter is missing (e.g., `todos` for `TodoWrite`), correct the call *before* execution.

- **Systematic Error Handling**: If a tool call fails with an `InputValidationError`:
  1.  Do not retry the exact same failed command.
  2.  Analyze the error message to identify the specific missing or incorrect parameter.
  3.  Construct a new, valid tool call with the corrected parameters.
  4.  Execute the corrected command.

- **Graceful Degradation**: If a complex tool fails for reasons beyond a simple input error, switch to a simpler, more reliable method. For example, if `MultiEdit` fails unexpectedly, break the task into smaller pieces and handle each with a separate `Edit` call. This ensures progress is not blocked by a single complex failure.
